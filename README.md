## Data  

### Data Source 

The dataset is provided by Möbius on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit). The dataset was created by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 12 April, 2016 and 12 May, 2016. Thirty Fitbit users consented to the submission of their personal tracker data.

### Data selection

`dailyActivity_merged.csv`, which is a combined data including the following information: total steps, active distance, active minutes and calories.

#### Limitations:

- Data was collected in 2016, which is outdated and cannot provide reliable results that can be used for new product in 2021.
- Data just included 33 users, which is not sufficient to reflect the whole population of targeted customers.


### Data Storage and Organization

The data is hosted on a [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit].
